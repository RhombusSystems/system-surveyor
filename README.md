# Rhombus System Surveyor Integration Profiles

This repository contains pre-configured element profiles for integrating Rhombus security devices with System Surveyor, a comprehensive security system design and surveying platform.

## What is System Surveyor?

System Surveyor is a professional tool used by security integrators and consultants to design, survey, and document security systems. It helps professionals create accurate system layouts, generate reports, and manage device inventories for security installations.

## What are Element Profiles?

Element profiles are configuration files that define device capabilities, specifications, and parameters within System Surveyor. These profiles ensure that Rhombus devices are properly represented with accurate technical specifications, mounting requirements, and operational parameters.
