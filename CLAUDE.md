# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains System Surveyor integration profiles for Rhombus security devices. The profiles are stored as Excel spreadsheet files (.xlsx) that define device capabilities and configurations for various Rhombus hardware components.

## Architecture

The repository is organized as a collection of device element profiles:

- **ACS Controller-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Access control system controller configuration
- **Card Reader-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Card reader device profile  
- **Fixed Camera-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Fixed camera device specifications
- **General Multi-Sensor Device-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Multi-sensor device profile
- **Microphone Element Profile.xlsx** - Audio device configuration
- **Multi-Lens Camera-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Multi-lens camera specifications
- **NVR-DVR-Element_Profile.xlsx** - Network/Digital Video Recorder profile

## Documentation

- **How to add Rhombus to System Surveyor.docx** - Integration guide document
- **Element Upload for System Surveyor.webm.webm** - Video tutorial for profile upload
- **Spec Sheets/** - Directory containing device specification sheets (D1, E1, E2, M1, T1 one-pagers)

## Working with Profiles

This repository contains no traditional code files - it's a collection of configuration profiles and documentation. Changes typically involve:

1. Updating Excel profile files to modify device capabilities or parameters
2. Adding new device profiles for additional Rhombus hardware
3. Updating documentation to reflect profile changes

## File Format Notes

All profile files are Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx) that follow System Surveyor's element profile format. These files cannot be edited with standard text editors and require Excel or compatible spreadsheet software for modifications.
